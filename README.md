# My Milestone Project 1

## A & B Roofing Services

### My Inspiration
This project is based on my husband's own business. He doesn't have a website at the moment so this is my first attempt at getting one up and running for him.
I've spoken to him reguarding what he would like to achieve out of this project of mine, he told me that this is web site will mainly be for the users that have a little of websites and technology.

### Goals of the project
I'm hoping to get this website live and accessible for all to use. Whether you have good or little understanding of how websites work, this website will be easy, simple and appealing to users of all ages.
It will contain;
1. Easy navigation
2. Simple and clear design
3. Information that is necessary to the business as is to the user.

### Description of my project

#### What will is do?
This project will contain information for users who require the company's services.
It's a small family run roofing company that has been running for over 10 years. Living in a small area in Wales, the business have loyal customers that reccomend to family and friends. I would like this website to have an 'easy use' approach as customers looking for roofing services will not need technical information, only useful and informative information. This will help them make the decision to choose the right company for the job, A & B Roofing Services.
