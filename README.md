# My Milestone Project 1

## A & B Roofing Services Website
This is a real world business that is looking for a responsive and easy to use websote for customers of all ages. This website will allow users to view previous jobs and see what the company offer in their services. Customers will have the ability to send an enquiry, use the click-to-call buttons at the very top and bottom of the page and visit the company's Facebook page.

## Design & Planning:

### Initial Discussions
A & B Roofing Services is a company in the real world that have been established since COVID came around. It is a family run business with over 30 years experience and have proven very popular and reliable in and around the Rhondda Valleys.
Customers have spread the word about A & B Roofing Services through general word of mouth but the company have been looking to create another way to reach their customers.

Along with Facebook and the local business magazine promotions, Brandon and Anthony have some concerns that these methods may not be enough. After a few customers asking and advising, the company finally decided to create their own website with easy to use features, the ability to call them on any page, access to their ever growing portfolio, a service page with all they can offer and an enquiry page.

### Key information for the site

* The company's commitment to provide the best work possible at a very reasonable price.
* Having more than one point of contact for convenient and easy user experience.
* Displaying previous work on the website that will give customers reassurance of a job well done.
* Simple design, not to overwhelm users.

### User Stories

#### User experience

* I would like the website to have a clear navigation area so that I can use get from page to page with easy.
* I would like there to be clear information on the first page I see so that I know immediately I'm visiting the correct site.
* I want the contact details to be accessible on all pages so that I can find them with just one click.
* I want to have the option to contact the company through their website so that I have more than one option to get hold of the company.
* I want to have a sign that tells me my enquiry has been sent so that I know the company has received it.

#### Company goals

* I want my website to have as much information as possible so that potential customers can see what we services we have to offer.
* I would like to include various jobs we've completed on the website so that customers can view what we can do and to the standard we're proud of.
* I want to have a Call Now button for an emergency or ease of contact so that the company can be contacted right-away.


### Wireframes

### Typography
I used Google Fonts to import fonts to use for the website.

I went with a combination on Nunito and Sans-Serif. Discussed with the company, these fonts seems very approachable, easy and friendly to the eye.
### Colour Scheme
As this is a project for an actual company, I've stuck with the color scheme given to me by their logo. Very minimalistic but effective.

## Features:
Explain your features on the website,(navigation, pages, links, forms.....)
The website has a collapsable navigation bar in the header and a contact section in the footer (more below).
Each page on the website contains the company's logo at the very top of the page, this is for the effect anf feeling of consistency throughout the site.
### Pages on the website consist of a; 
* Home page - The home page of the website contains the company's about us section where they express their dedication and commitment to deliver high quality roofing services.
* Services page - This is where the public and potential customers come to find out what the company has to offer and work they carry out. It contains a list of the works, this includes clickable text for the users to visually see the jobs undertaken under that name. There is also an image carousel displaying various completed jobs.
* Gallery page - The company specifically asked for a page where they can display a range of jobs they have completed, mainly before and after images. Users can view the range and quality of work done by the business. The page also contains a video taken from a large job the company had completed recently.
* Enquiry & Thank you page - This page is for the users to input their enquiry and send to the company out of the working hours. Once sending off the enquiry (after filling in each box) the user will be greeted with a thank you page, an acknowledgment that their form has been sent to the company.
### Navigation
Within the navigation section of the site, there are 7 clickable links.
1. The company's logo will take you directly to the home page, as will the Home link on the right hand side of the site.
2. Services.
3. Gallery.
4. Enquiry
5. Contact will take you to the bottom of each page to the Contact Us section.
6. Call Now. This button in the navigation will appear only on phone devices and once clicked on, will give the user the ability to call the company immediately.

The navigation bar has a collapsable feature for smaller devices and will drop down when clicked on. After clicking the desired page, the menu will collapse.
### Footer
The footer contains the company's contact section. The section has links to the company's Facebook page and when on mobile devices, the ability to click on the contact numbers to call the company immediately.

## Bugs
### Company logo 
The logo would cause the layout on each page to change when the pixels went below 340px. this was solved (with the help from my mentor Matt) by adding a max hidth and height to it in the CSS stylesheet.

### Navigation
The collapsed navigation, at 320px, would position itself under the company's name in the header. I was able to correct this by giving the Call Now and Nav button a specific order in a media query.

### Modals
The modal each had an id attached to them which was picked up by the validation checks. I had changes the id to a class attribute to clear this error.

### Images
The images had taken up most of my time on this project as i had not correctly sized them for the website. I asked for help of my mentor and tutor to walk me through what I could do to better my practice. The tutor had suggested me to resixe the images in paint and convert them all to WEBP to achieve the best score on the Lighthouse text.

### Enquiry page
The form on the enquiry page was originally set a triangle layout when the page had reach the desktop width. My mentor made a very valid point in that people are not used to form displaying as a triangle. He suggested that I change the layout to a box as this is usually what people would expect.


## Deployment

#### Deloying on Github
The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:
- Go to the Github repository.
- Navigate to the 'settings' tab.
- Using the 'select branch' dropdown menu, choose 'main'.
- Click 'save'.
