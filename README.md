## Deployment

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.
#### Deloying on Github
The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:
- Go to the Github repository.
- Navigate to the 'settings' tab.
- Using the 'select branch' dropdown menu, choose 'main'.
- Click 'save'.

### My Inspiration
This project is based on my husband's own business. He doesn't have a website at the moment so this is my first attempt at getting one up and running for him.
I've spoken to him reguarding what he would like to achieve out of this project of mine, he told me that this is web site will mainly be for the users that have a little of websites and technology.

### Goals of the project
I'm hoping to get this website live and accessible for all to use. Whether you have good or little understanding of how websites work, this website will be easy, simple and appealing to users of all ages.
It will contain;
1. Easy navigation
2. Simple and clear design
3. Information that is necessary to the business as is to the user.

### Description of my project

#### What will is do?
This project will contain information for users who require the company's services.
It's a small family run roofing company that has been running for over 10 years. Living in a small area in Wales, the business have loyal customers that reccomend to family and friends. I would like this website to have an 'easy use' approach as customers looking for roofing services will not need technical information, only useful and informative information. This will help them make the decision to choose the right company for the job, A & B Roofing Services.

#### The steps I've taken to achieve this project

I used the github projects section to create a number of user stories (as seen in screenshots).
I had also used wireframes to plan out my design of the website and it's different pages.(screenshots)


#### Why I used these specific technologies?

#### The challenges I faced
I came across a couple of challenges in this project. I had placed id and classes in wrong divs but after a little experimenting and realisations, I was able to read the code better and understand where to place the classes and ids to achieve the style I was hoping to.

The main challenge I had faced was the Gallery page. This was made me was to take at least an hour's break from coding that day to just sit, relax and come back with a clear mind on things.
The look I wanted to achieve in the gallery was to have all images placed in a grid and for them to be displayed next to each other when the devices got bigger. I tried putting all images in a single div, wrong move! Then after searching on Google and reading other coders issues and solutions, I was able to scrap my initial thought and apply a new layout with # and . in the correct places to achieve it's current look.

#### What I would like to add in the future!
I would love to add a few more things to the website (after speaking to the company owner, my husband), such as a form to be able to submit an issue, call out or a call back.
I would'nt like to alter the website too much as the company would like it to be as accessible and user friendly, they have many customers that aren't very IT literate and will have great difficulty if the website was overwhelming and busy.

### Would you like to use my project?

/*
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
